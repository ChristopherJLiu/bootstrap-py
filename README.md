# BOOTSTRAP-PY #

Simple Rest API contained using docker.


### Executing

To run the solution, at project root, execute 

docker-compose up --build

After the API is running to get weather of a city do:
http://localhost:5656/weather/city/3448433 which will request SÃ£o Paulo Brazil weather (3448433 number is dynamic)

To get another cities go to : https://openweathermap.org/ and search a city and copy the city id

### Developing

For development after executing docker-compose, if on a wait status service, e.g. REST, all files while saved wont do an automatic re-run of the code.
Although the file app/init.dev.sh is still included in the package, the docker compose file should be changed by replacing: command:  python do.py with

        command: >
                /bin/bash -c "/app/init.dev.sh
                "


So for alive services, docker-compose should be turned down then turned up again to see changes of the code being executed.



### Testing

Tests are named test_* and are inside app/tests/ folder

To run the solution, at project root, execute 

docker-compose -f tests/docker-compose.yml up --build

Project is using unittest from Python
